# Data: [Bank Marketing Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) 

# Problem Description:
 The "Bank Marketing Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y). In this assignment we have to build three classifiers for this data set: a decision tree, a naive Bayesian classifier, and a support vector machine and we have to do 10-fold cross validation to evaluate our classifier.

# Soultion:

## Dataset Description:
> The dataset has no missing values.

> The class distribution is skewed heavilly.
